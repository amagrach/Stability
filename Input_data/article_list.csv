,,A keystone mutualism promotes resistance to invasion,Journal of Animal Ecology,"Agustin Vitali1 | Diego P. Vázquez2,3 | María F. Miguel2 | Yamila Sasal1 |
Mariano A. Rodríguez-Cabal1,4","1. It is not uncommon for one or a few species, and their interactions, to have disproportionate
effects on other species in ecological communities. Such keystone
interactions might affect how communities respond to the invasion of non-native
species by preventing or inhibiting the establishment, spread or impact of non-native
species.
2. We explore whether a keystone mutualism among a hummingbird–mistletoe–
marsupial
promotes ecological resistance to an invasive pollinator, the bumblebee
Bombus terrestris, by comparing data collected at sites prior to bumblebee invasion
to data collected 11 years after the invasion in sites with and without the keystone
mutualism.
3. We built pollination networks and focused on network motifs, regarded as building
blocks of networks, to identify the central pollinators and estimate the change
in their interactions after invasion of B. terrestris. We also estimated the interaction
rewiring across the season in post-invasion
networks and tested it as a
possible mechanism explaining how the keystone mutualism increased ecological
resistance to invasion.
4. We found two times more species in post-invasion
sites with the keystone mutualism
than in post-invasion
sites without the keystone mutualism. Moreover, we
found that invasive bumblebee reduced the strength and interaction niche of the
five central pollinator species while increasing its own strength and interaction
niche, suggesting a replacement of interactions. Also, we found that the keystone
mutualism promoted resistance to B. terrestris invasion by reducing its negative
impacts on central species. In the presence of the keystone mutualism, central
species had three times more direct interactions than in sites without this keystone
mutualism. The higher interaction rewiring, after invasion of B. terrestris, in
sites with the keystone mutualism indicates greater chances of central pollinators
to form new interactions and reduces their competence for resources with the
non-native
bumblebee.
5. Our results demonstrate that a keystone mutualism can enhance community resistance
against the impacts of a non-native
invasive pollinator by increasing species
diversity and promoting interaction rewiring in the community. This study suggests that the conservation of mutualisms, especially those considered keystone,
could be essential for long-term
preservation of natural communities under
current and future impacts of global change.",2021,91,74-85,Argentina,Subantarctic,Forests,1,Interaction turnover as measure of persistnce to invasion,Persistence,Interactions,Temporal and spatial,Site,8,,Inter-annual,two sampling periods 11 years apart,"Also, we found that the keystone

A particularly intriguing aspect of these systems is their high diversity. However, earlier studies have concluded that the specific mechanisms of plant-pollinator interactions are destabilizing and should lead to a loss of diversity. Here we present a mechanistic model of plant and pollinator population dynamics with the ability to represent a broad spectrum of interaction structures. Using this model, we examined the influence of pollinators on the stability of a plant community and the relationship between pollinator specialization and stability. In accordance with earlier work, our results show that plant-pollinator interactions may severely destabilize plant coexistence, regardless of the degree of pollinator specialization. However, if plant niche differentiation, a classical stabilizing mechanism, is sufficiently strong to overcome the minority disadvantage with respect to pollination, interactions with pollinators may even increase the stability of a plant community.

Using plant-pollinator network models as an example, we contrast the predicted vulnerability of a community to secondary extinctions under the assumption of purely mutualistic interactions versus mutualistic and competitive interactions. We find that competition among plant species increases the risk of secondary extinctions and extinction cascades. Simulations over a number of different network structures indicate that this effect is stronger in larger networks, more strongly connected networks and networks with higher plant:pollinator ratios. We conclude that efforts to model plant-pollinator communities will systematically over-estimate community robustness to species loss if plant competition is ignored. However, because the effect of plant competition depends on network architecture, and because characterization of plant competition is work intensive, we suggest that efforts to account for plant competition in plant-pollinator network models should be focused on large, strongly connected networks with high plant:pollinator ratios.",2013,122,1710-1719,NA,NA,NA,1,Resistance measured as robustness to species coextinctions,Resistance,Species,,Simulation,,,Before after species removal,,"We find that interspecific plant competition causes a systematic increase in the incidence of secondary plant extinctions.

We estimated the interannual similarity in interactions and assessed the determinants of their persistence.

However, these grasslands often contain few resources for flower-visiting insects, which provide pollination services for crops. In this study, we investigate if both high yield and floral resources for pollinators can be achieved in intensively managed grasslands by varying species diversity and composition, and cutting frequency. Four perennial grassland mixtures containing 3, 5, 11 and 13 species of grasses and/or forbs were established at three sites varying in surrounding landscape, and plots were managed with three cutting strategies (four cuts per year, two cuts per year and no cut). Biomass production was measured as annual herbage yield. Every 2-4 weeks throughout the flowering season, flower abundance, richness, temporal stability and flower-visiting insects were monitored. The 11- and 13-species mixtures, designed to enhance pollinators, produced similar or higher herbage yield than the 3-species mixture under a two-cut strategy or the 5-species mixture under a four-cut strategy. The 3- and 5- species mixtures had a high accumulated flower abundance due to excessive flowering of lucerne under the two-cut strategy and white clover under the four-cut strategy. Interestingly, flower abundance was not significantly reduced under the twocut strategy compared to no cut. As expected, the 11- and 13- species mixtures presented a higher diversity of flowers during the flowering season. Flower temporal stability was generally higher in 11- and 13-species mixtures under the two-cut strategy, while it was highest in the 5-species mixture under the four-cut strategy. Pollinator profiles (visits by different functional groups of insects) were plant-species specific, and varied very little among sites. Legume species mainly attracted large bees (honey bees and bumblebees), while the most abundant forbs attracted other insect groups, in particular syrphids and other flies.

Specifically, as cities expand in size, an increasing proportion of regional pasture and grassland habitat is being replaced by urban development, and fewer periodic grazing and burning regimes are being supported locally, despite evidence that such regimes promote plant species richness and facilitate their interaction with native pollinators. The quantification of these plant-pollinator networks-through indices such as network connectance, specialization, nestedness, and robustness-can provide a unique opportunity to characterize key structural properties of species interactions and their response to human management and seasonal phenology. While urbanization and local disturbance regimes likely influence plant and pollinator communities and their interactions, past research in this area has primarily been conducted at limited spatial and temporal scales and has not typically quantified the impacts of both local and landscape forces on network properties. In this study, we investigate the effects of contemporary (past 10 years) and historic (prior 90 years) disturbance regimes on plant-pollinator community composition and network structure across more than 200 km of grassland in Central Texas. Our analyses indicate that for plant and pollinator communities, both contemporary and historic land management practices have led to significantly dissimilar community composition. Plant and pollinator richness and network nestedness are negatively correlated with phenological period, while pollinator richness is positively correlated with landscape-scale (2 km) urbanized land cover and is higher in historically grazed land, likely due to greater food and nesting resource availability. In contrast, we show that network connectance is positively correlated with phenological period and negatively correlated with landscape-scale urban cover. Finally, we show that pollinator robustness, a measure of resilience to plant species loss, is positively correlated with landscape-scale urbanization, likely due to greater redundancy provided by common weedy plant species.

Pollination studies are currently flourishing at all possible levels of interaction organization (i.e., species, guild, group and network), and different methodological protocols aimed to define the resilience of pollination interactions have been proposed. However, the temporal dimension of the resilience of pollination interactions has been often overlooked. In the light of these considerations, we addressed the following questions: does a temporal approach help to reveal critical moments during the flowering season, when pollination interactions are less resilient to perturbations? Do pollination interactions evaluated at species, guild, group and network level show different patterns when assessed through time?
Methods We monitored contacts between plant and pollinator species in dry grassland communities every 15 days during the overall community flowering season (12 surveys). For each survey, we built a quantitative plant-pollinator interaction matrix and we calculated two sets of metrics characterizing, respectively, the diversity and the distribution of interactions across hierarchical levels. To describe the diversity of interactions, we calculated partner diversity (PD) at the species level, vulnerability/generality (V/G) at the guild level, and interaction diversity and evenness at the network level. The distribution of interactions was characterized by calculating selectiveness at the species and the network level, and modularity at the group level. We assessed the temporal variation of PD, V/G at the level of plants and pollinators, and species selectiveness, by means of Linear Mixed Models (LMMs). To investigate the temporal variation of indexes calculated at group and network level, we applied simple linear and quadratic regressions after checking for temporal autocorrelation in residuals.
Important Findings When taking into account the temporal dimension of interactions, the diversity of interactions showed different patterns at different levels of organization. At the species level, no relationship was disclosed between PD and time, when assessing the temporal trend of V/G separately for the guild of plants and pollinators we observed an asymmetric structure of interactions. Pollination interactions showed to be asymmetric throughout the flowering season; however, evenness of interactions and network selectiveness showed significant positive relationships with time, revealing a poorer network of interactions during the end of the flowering season.

Yet, few studies have considered the effect this has on pollinator population stability, nor how this might be mitigated to maintain consistent crop pollination services. We assess the potential of boundary features (standard narrow 1 m grassy margins, hedgerows and wide 4 m agri-environment margins) to support and stabilise pollinator populations and pollination service in agricultural landscapes under crop rotation. Assuming a 6-year rotation, we use a process-based pollinator model to predict yearly pollinator population size and in-crop visitation rates to oilseed rape and field bean across 117 study landscapes in England with varying amounts of boundary features. We model both ground-nesting bumblebees and solitary bees and compare the predictions including and excluding boundary features from the landscapes. Ground-nesting bumblebee populations, whose longer-lifetime colonies benefit from continuity of resources, were larger and more stable (relative to the no-features scenario) in landscapes with more boundary features. Ground-nesting solitary bee populations were also larger but not significantly more stable, except with the introduction of wide permanent agri-environment margins, due to their shorter lifetimes and shorter foraging/dispersal ranges. Crop visitation by ground-nesting bumblebees was greater and more stable in landscapes with more boundary features, partly due to increased colony growth prior to crop flowering. Time averaged crop visitation by ground-nesting solitary bees was slightly lower, due to females dividing their foraging time between boundary features and the crop. However, despite this, the minimum pollination service delivered was higher, due to the more stable delivery. Synthesis and applications. Field boundary features have an important role in stabilising pollinator populations and pollination service in rotational systems, although maintenance of larger semi-natural habitat patches may be more effective for stabilising less mobile solitary bee populations.

In contrast with the prolific body of experimental research, few studies have examined how species richness affects the stability of ecosystem services at more realistic, landscape scales. The paucity of these studies is due in part to a lack of analytical methods that are suitable for the correlative structure of ecological data.

We find that additive and interactive effects of habitat fragmentation at local (fragment size) and landscape scales (1,750 m radius) directly shape species communities by altering the number of interacting species and, indirectly, their body size composition.

These structural patterns are impacted by a suite of variables, including species traits, species abundances, their spatial configuration, and their phylogenetic history. Here, we consider a specific trait: phenology, or the timing of life history events. We expect that timing and duration of activity of pollinators, or of flowering in plants, could greatly affect the species' roles within networks in which they are embedded. Using plant-pollinator networks from 33 sites in southern British Columbia, Canada, we asked (a) how phenological species traits, specifically timing of first appearance in the network and duration of activity in a network, were related to species' roles within a network, and (b) how those traits affected network robustness to phenologically biased species loss. We found that long duration of activity increased connection within modules for both pollinators and plants and among modules for plants. We also found that date of first appearance was positively related to interaction strength asymmetry in plants but negatively related to pollinators. Networks were generally more robust to the loss of pollinators than plants, and robustness increased if the models allow new interactions to form when old ones are lost, constrained by overlapping phenology of plants and pollinators. Robustness declined with the loss of late-flowering plants, which tended to have higher interaction strength asymmetry. In addition, robustness declined with loss of early-flying or long-duration pollinators. These pollinators tended to be among-module connectors.

We find that consumer-resource mechanisms underlying plant-pollinator mutualisms can increase persistence, productivity, abundance, and temporal stability of both mutualists and non-mutualists in food webs. These effects strongly increase with floral reward productivity and are qualitatively robust to variation in the prevalence of mutualism and pollinators feeding upon resources in addition to rewards. This work advances the ability of mechanistic network theory to synthesize different types of interactions and illustrates how mutualism can enhance the diversity, stability, and function of complex ecosystems.

Human wellbeing depends not only on the quantity of agricultural yields, but also on the stability and resilience of crop production. Yet a broad understanding of how the diversity and composition of pollinator communities may influence crop pollination service has previously been hindered by a scarcity of standardized data. We used outputs from Bayesian occupancy detection models to examine patterns in the inter-annual occupancy dynamics of the bee pollinator communities of four contrasting crops (apples, field bean, oilseed and strawberries) in Great Britain between 1985 and 2015. We compared how the composition and species richness of different crop pollinator communities may affect the stability of crop pollinator occurrence. Across the four crops, we found that the inter-annual occupancy dynamics of the associated pollinator communities tended to be more similar in smaller communities with closely related pollinator species. Our results indicate that crop pollinator communities composed of a small number of closely related bee species show greater variance in mean occupancy compared to crops with more diverse pollinator communities. Lower variance in the occurrence of crop pollinating bee species may lead to more stable crop pollination services. Finally, whilst our results initially indicated some redundancy within most crop pollinator communities, with no, or little, increase in the variance of overall mean occupancy when species were initially removed, this was followed by a rapid acceleration in the variance of crop pollinator occurrence as each crop's bee pollinator community was increasingly depreciated. High inter-annual variations in pollination services have negative implications for crop production and food security.

This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination.
The Study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and coffee pollination.
Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and 60% per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500 m isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit set per agro-forest.

Overall, landscape heterogeneity increased the spatial stability (i.e., decreased spatial variability) of pollination services to almond trees.

The stability of plant-pollinator communities might increase in heterogeneous landscapes with a high diversity of species and alternative habitats, both through larger independent fluctuations of populations (portfolio effect) and increased species asynchrony. However, how the drivers of stability (portfolio effect and synchrony) vary along land-use gradients remains largely unknown. Using independent samplings for plants, pollinators and their interactions in Mediterranean communities along a gradient of landscape heterogeneity, we assessed the relationships between within-year stability and its drivers, and between the drivers of stability, landscape heterogeneity and species diversity. In addition, we evaluated the relationship between the stability of plant-pollinator interactions (temporal mean/SD of pairwise interactions) and the structure of mutualistic networks (modularity, nestedness, connectance). As expected, stability increased with larger portfolio effects and asynchronies. Interaction stability was positively related to pollinator stability, but not to plant stability. Landscape evenness increased the stability of plants, pollinators and their interactions, through increased portfolio effects. However, for plants and pollinators, the effect was detected at a smaller scale (1-km) than for interactions (2-km); and for pollinators and interactions, the effect was only evident from medium-to-high levels of landscape evenness. Temporal synchrony of species/pairwise interactions was an important driver of stability, tightly linked to species/interaction diversity. More asynchronous communities showed a larger portfolio effect and were also those with higher species evenness for all plants, pollinators and their interactions; while synchrony was also weakly positively related to species richness for plants.

Plant-insect assemblages are well-suited for the study of ecological resilience as they are species-rich and encompass a variety of ecological interactions that correspond to essential ecosystem functions.
Mechanisms affecting community response to perturbations depend on both the natural history and structure of ecological interactions. Natural history attributes of the interspecific interactions, for example whether they are mutualistic or antagonistic, may affect the ecological resilience by controlling the demographic feedbacks driving ecological dynamics at the community level. Interaction generalisation may also affect resilience, by defining opportunities for interaction rewiring, the extent to which species are able to switch interactions in fluctuating environments. These natural history attributes may also interact with network structure to affect ecological resilience.
Using adaptive network models, we investigated the resilience of plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore networks to species loss. We specifically investigated how fundamental natural history differences between these systems, namely the demographic consequences of the interaction and their level of generalisation-mediating rewiring opportunities-affect the resilience of dynamic ecological networks to extinctions. We also create a general benchmark for the effect of network structure on resilience simulating extinctions on theoretical networks with controlled structures.
When network structure was static, pollination networks were less resilient than herbivory networks; this is related to their high levels of nestedness and the reciprocally positive feedbacks that define mutualisms, which made co-extinction cascades more likely and longer in plant-pollinator assemblages. When considering interaction rewiring, the high generalisation and the structure of pollination networks boosted their resilience to extinctions, which approached those of herbivory networks. Simulation results using theoretical networks suggested that the empirical structure of herbivory networks may protect them from collapse.
Elucidating the ecological and evolutionary processes driving interaction rewiring is key to understanding the resilience of plant-insect assemblages.

However, there is no simple and rapid method to assess the pollination services over large areas. Here, we introduce two new indices to measure pollination services and its temporal stability in farmland, the Pollination Services Index and the index of Temporal Variation in Pollination Services, that only require readily available data, namely crop yield and crop pollinator dependence. The philosophy of these indices is to compare at a given site the standardized yield, or the temporal variation in yield, among crops that have different levels of dependence on animal pollinators for their production. We expect that where there is a shortage of pollinators, standardized crop yields should decrease, and temporal variation in crop yields should increase, with increasing dependence on pollinators. The Pollination Services Index in a given area is thus defined as the slope of the linear regression between standardized crop yield and crop pollinator dependence; the Temporal Variation in Pollination Services is defined as the slope of the linear regression between the inter-annual coefficient of variation of crop yield and crop pollinator dependence. We calculated these two indices in France, where we show extensive spatial variation in the estimated pollination services. We further show that this variation in the Pollination Services Index is negatively correlated with the index of Temporal Variation in Pollination Services, and positively correlated with habitat quality for pollinators. At a spatial resolution of administrative departments (ca. 5,800 km(2)), the results show that intensive farming is positively correlated with higher Temporal Variation in Pollination Services but is not significantly associated with the Pollination Services Index, probably due to multicollinearity issues.

Our capacity to ensure the provision of ecosystem services (ES), the sustainability of agroecosystems and the efficiency of agri-environmental schemes (AES) relies on this knowledge. There is growing interest in how biodiversity and ES are affected by the interplay between landscape characteristics and agricultural management (e.g., intermediate landscape complexity hypothesis; ILCH). However, studies have typically focused on classical measures of community structure (e.g., species abundance, richness and biodiversity), tending to neglect the effects on the structure and stability of ecological networks and the increased risk of biotic homogenization (i.e., loss of beta-diversity). In this work, we use bee trap nests to sample pollen-solitary bee mutualistic networks in 9 pairs of olive groves under different management regimes (conventional vs. organic) in a landscape complexity gradient in southern Spain. We analyse the mutualistic networks at farm level to test the ILCH and study how agricultural practices and landscape complexity interact to affect the properties of these networks. We also explore the effects on spatial biotic homogenization by performing multivariate analyses of the composition and abundance of bee-plant communities and their pairwise interactions. The results show that solitary bee-plant networks have greater complexity and stability on organic olive farms embedded in relatively heterogeneous landscapes.

It remains unclear if biodiversity drives productivity or productivity shapes biodiversity or the relationship is bidirectional. B-EF studies explore almost exclusively the relationship between species richness and ecosystem functioning, while the role of biotic interactions, a key component of ecosystem functioning, has been neglected. Here, using data of 80 local plant-pollinator networks on 20 Aegean islands, and of gross primary productivity (GPP) from the MODIS satellite, we explored the bidirectional relationship between interaction network structure (nestedness and specialization), species richness (plants and pollinators) and mean and inter-annual variability of GPP. We found that nestedness and specialisation of plant-pollinator networks is driven by mean GPP. However, specialisation alone was a significant predictor of mean GPP, implying that networks tend to be more specialised in low-productivity areas. Pollinator species richness exerted a strong effect on mean GPP with the remaining factors playing a minor role, while the effect of mean GPP on pollinator species richness was weaker. Furthermore, the nestedness of plant-pollinator networks drives inter-annual variability of GPP with more nested networks displaying less variability, which is in accordance with the predictions of the insurance hypothesis.

There is consensus that increased food production is necessary, but not sufficient, to achieve food security, and that agriculture should also aim at stabilizing crop production over time. In this context, biodiversity-based approaches to food security are increasingly being supported based on the fact that biodiversity can increase and stabilize crop production. However, agricultural systems are often highly fragmented and our current understanding of how such fragmentation affects biodiversity and food production remains incomplete, thus limiting our capacity to manage agricultural landscapes for food security. We developed a spatially explicit model of crop dynamics to investigate how the fragmentation of natural habitats for agricultural conversion impacts food production and food security, with a focus on animal-dependent crop production. Fragmentation produces a variety of spatial and biodiversity-mediated effects that affect both the mean and stability (temporal invariability) of animal-dependent crop production. Fragmentation has a dual effect on animal-dependent production. On the one hand, spatial aggregation of natural land decreases animal-dependent production by reducing the Landscape Pollination Potential, a metric that captures fragmentation and pollinator spillover effects within the agricultural landscape. But aggregation increases animal-dependent production by maintaining a higher pollinator diversity in larger fragments of natural habitat. The net effects of fragmentation on animal-dependent crop production depend on the land-use change pattern, the strength of the pollinator spillover to crop land and the animal pollination dependence of crops. Synthesis. Our study sheds new light in the food security debate by showing that high and stable crop production depends on biodiversity and the spatial fragmentation of agricultural landscapes, and by revealing the ecological mechanisms of food security in crop pollination systems. Management for food security should consider factors such as pollinators' spillover, the amount and spatial aggregation of semi-natural habitat and the animal pollination dependence of crops. This information would be useful to design agricultural landscapes for high Landscape Pollination Potential.

Thus, in this study, the effects of climate change velocity and human activities on mutualistic network resilience were investigated.

Moreover, the potential confounding effects of network size, current climate and altitude were statistically controlled. It was demonstrated that mutualistic network resilience was globally influenced by warming velocity and human impact, in addition to current climate.

In seasonally dry Neotropical habitats, where month-long periods of extreme drought are followed by a long rainy season, flowering is often synchronized with the beginning of precipitation, when environmental conditions are most beneficial for plant reproduction. In the Brazilian Cerrado, a seasonally dry ecosystem considered one of the world's biodiversity hotspots for angiosperms, plants with shallow root systems flower predominantly during the rainy season. Foraging activity in social bees however, the major pollinators in this biome, is not restricted to any particular season because a constant supply of resources is necessary to sustain their perennial colonies. Despite the Cerrado's importance as a center of plant diversity, the influence of its extreme cycles of drought and precipitation on the dynamics and stability of plant-pollinator communities is not well understood. We sampled plant-pollinator interactions of a Cerrado community weekly for one year and used network analyses to characterize intra-annual seasonal variation in community structure. We also compared seasonal differences in community robustness to species loss by simulating extinctions of plants and pollinators. We find that the community shrinks significantly in size during the dry season, becoming more vulnerable to disturbance due to the smaller pool of floral hosts available to pollinators during this period. Major changes in plant species composition but not in pollinators has led to high levels of turnover in plant-pollinator associations across seasons, indicated by in interaction dissimilarity (< 3% of shared interactions).

In fragmented habitats, the low nestedness of mutualistic networks may be related to the position change of stable (high persistence over time/space) species and interactions in the networks. Previous studies have shown that stable species and interactions tend to be in the core position of mutualistic networks. However, in fragmented habitats, it remains unknown whether stable species or interactions still tend to be in the core position. To address this gap, here we evaluated the correlation between the position of proximity to the network core and the temporal/spatial stability of species and interactions, using the observation of 42 plant-pollinator networks conducted in a fragmented island landscape over 3 years. We showed that temporally/spatially stable species and interactions deviated from the network core to varying degrees. Temporally stable plants were most likely to deviate from the network core, followed by pollinators and interactions, while only spatially stable pollinators tend to deviate from the network core.

However, with the use of 1/CV, two issues arise when calculating the stability of interactions (Chacoff et al. 2018), as presented below.
First, the frequency of interactions usually widely varies over time and space due to environmental factors, such as phenology, climate change and habitat fragmentation (Fortuna and Bascompte 2006, Hegland et al. 2009, Rafferty and Ives 2011, Chase et al. 2020, Peralta et al. 2020). These variations thus lead to considerable number of interactions only occurred once over time or space (Petanidou et al. 2008, Aizen et al. 2012, Chacoff et al. 2018). For these interactions, the value 1/CV is derived to be a constant value (11//CVn=) which only relates to the total number of n years or n sites (details of this derivation in the Supporting information). Second and more importantly, the value 1/CV neglects the span of interactions over time and space, which makes some rarely occurred interactions more stable than widely occurred interactions. The above two aspects lead to inaccurate calculations of the stability of interactions. Consequently, here we propose a new method to calculate 1/CV, in order to appropriately evaluate the stability of interactions. The new method considers two perspectives for the stability of interactions: the span (denoted as S, the number of years or sites in which non-zero interaction was observed; Supporting information) and the variability (CV),",Temporal invariability,Species and interactions,Temporal and spatial,Site,42, 2 100x4m transects,Inter-annual,Biweekly for 3 years,"Temporally stable plants were most likely to deviate
from the network core, followed by pollinators and interactions, while only spatially
stable pollinators tend to deviate from the network core. When unstable species (present
in few time/space points, typically specialists) and interactions occupy the network
core, they cannot interact with most species in the network as generalists do, resulting
in the decrease of network nestedness. Therefore, from the perspective of position and
stability, stable species and interactions deviate from the network core in fragmented
habitats, which is an important reason for the decrease of nestedness in mutualistic
networks. Our study suggests that protecting plants which occupy the core in large

It is important to understand how the floral resource supply of gardens varies in both space and time so we can develop evidence-based management recommendations to support pollinator conservation in towns and cities. We surveyed 59 residential gardens in the city of Bristol, UK, at monthly intervals from March to October. For each of 472 garden surveys, we combined floral abundances with nectar sugar data to quantify the nectar production of each garden, investigating the magnitude, temporal stability, and diversity and composition of garden nectar supplies. We found that individual gardens differ markedly in the quantity of nectar sugar they supply (from 2 to 1,662 g), and nectar production is higher in more affluent neighbourhoods, but not in larger gardens. Nectar supply peaks in July (mid-summer), when more plant taxa are in flower, but temporal patterns vary among individual gardens. At larger spatial scales, temporal variability averages out through the portfolio effect, meaning insect pollinators foraging across many gardens in urban landscapes have access to a relatively stable and continuous supply of nectar through the year. Turnover in species composition among gardens leads to an extremely high overall plant richness, with 636 taxa recorded flowering. The nectar supply is dominated by non-natives, which provide 91% of all nectar sugar, while shrubs are the main plant life form contributing to nectar production (58%). Two-thirds of nectar sugar is only available to relatively specialised pollinators, leaving just one-third that is accessible to all. Synthesis and applications.

Nevertheless, up to now there have been few attempts to investigate the interplay between the structure of real pollination networks and their dynamics. This study is one of the first contributions to explore this issue. Biological invasions, of major concern for conservation, are also poorly understood from the perspective of complex ecological networks. In this paper we assess the role that established alien species play within a host community by analyzing the temporal changes in structural network properties driven by the removal of non-native plants. Three topological measures have been used to represent the most relevant structural properties for the stability of ecological networks: degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity. Therefore, we investigate for a detailed pollination network, 1) how its dynamics, represented as changes in species abundances, affect the evolution of its structure, 2) how topology relates to dynamics focusing on long-term species persistence; and 3) how both structure and dynamics are affected by the removal of alien plant species. Network dynamics were simulated by means of a stochastic metacommunity model. Our results showed that established alien plants are important for the persistence of the pollination network and for the maintenance of its structure. Removal of alien plants decreased the likelihood of species persistence. On the other hand, both the full network and the subset native network tended to lose their structure through time. Nevertheless, the structure of the full network was better preserved than the structure of the network without alien plants. Temporal topological shifts were evident in terms of degree distribution, nestedness, and modularity. However the effects of removing alien plants were more pronounced for degree distribution and modularity of the network.

However, environmental change may re-organise network structure limiting capacity to absorb or resist shocks and increasing species extinctions. We investigated if habitat disturbance and the level of mutualism dependence between species affected the robustness of insect-flower visitation networks Following a recently developed Stochastic Co-extinction Model (SCM), we ran simulations to produce the number of extinction episodes (cascade degree), which we correlated with network structure in undisturbed and disturbed habitat. We also explicitly modelled whether a species' intrinsic dependence on mutualism affected the propensity for extinction cascades in the network. Habitat disturbance generated a gradient in network structure with those from disturbed sites being less connected, but more speciose and so larger. Controlling for network size (z-score standardisation against the null model) revealed that disturbed networks had disproportionately low linkage density, high specialisation, fewer insect visitors per plant species (vulnerability) and lower nestedness (NODF). This network structure gradient driven by disturbance increased and decreased different aspects of robustness to simulated plant extinction. Disturbance decreased the risk that an initial insect extinction would follow a plant species loss. Although, this effect disappeared when network size and connectance were standardised, suggesting the lower connectance of disturbed networks increased robustness to an initial secondary extinction. However, if a secondary extinction occurred then networks from disturbed habitat were more prone to large co-extinction cascades, likely resulting from a greater chance of extinction in these larger, speciose networks. Conversely, when species mutualism dependency was explicit in the SCM simulations the disturbed networks were disproportionately more robust to very large co-extinction cascades, potentially caused by non-random patterns of interaction between species differing in dependence on mutualism. Our results showed disturbance altered the size and the distribution of interspecific interactions in the networks to affect their robustness to co-extinction cascades. Controlling for effects due to network size and the interspecific variation in demographic dependence on mutualism can improve insight into properties conferring the structural robustness of networks to environmental changes.

Despite increasing attention, simulation models to estimate the robustness of interaction networks largely neglect the important role of interaction rewiring, that is, the ability of species to switch partners. Here we propose a new method to incorporate the potential of species to replace lost partners into a widely used coextinction model to estimate network robustness. In this model, species are allowed to rewire their interactions after initial loss of partners according to probabilities derived from well-known mechanisms that determine mutualistic interactions, for example, trait matching, phenological overlap and abundances. To illustrate the use of this method, we analyzed a well-sampled dataset of mutualistic plant-hummingbird interactions. We found that (a) in general, rewiring increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks are similarly robust to the loss of pollinators or plants, (c) morphological matching and phenological overlap leads to higher robustness, (d) when multiple rewiring mechanisms are combined, however, robustness increases little, and (e) rewiring tends to increase robustness more in scenarios when the loss of generalist species occurs first. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms known to drive plant-hummingbird network structure are relevant in buffering the effects of species loss via rewiring. The method proposed here can be applied to a wide range of interaction networks and is flexible to the inclusion of other variables important in determining interactions for specific systems. It also allows changes on the assumptions regarding the importance of distinct mechanisms, for instance including a hierarchical relationship, which facilitates insights into the relative importance of multiple variables influencing network disassembling. The analytical framework we offer here represents a step towards a more realistic estimation on how species loss may affect the integrity of interaction networks.",2019,11,106-116,Brazil ,Tropical,Neotropical Atlantic Rainforest,1,"We here present a metric (named Rw) which represents the simulated
rate of coextinctions while allowing species that lost partners
the chance to rewire their interactions to surviving partners. This
metric builds upon the metric R (Burgos et al., 2007) implemented
as the robustness function in the R‐package bipartite (Dormann,
Fründ, Blütghen, & Gruber, 2009). R estimates the proportion of
species in a trophic level that remains in a bipartite network after
sequential extirpations of species in the other trophic level. It assumes
that a species goes extinct when all partners to whom it is
connected are lost. It is calculated as the area below the Attack
Tolerance Curve, which represents the curve of the fraction of surviving
species of one trophic level as a function of the eliminated
species from the other trophic level. R ranges from 0 to 1, with values
closer to 1 indicating higher robustness of the system, meaning
that coextinction rates are slower (Burgos et al., 2007). Rw follows
the same calculation, differing in that every time a species loses a
partner, it is assigned a probability of rewiring its interactions to
the persisting potential partners. This probability of rewiring is defined
by a set of rules based on mechanisms known to drive interactions
– and therefore rewiring – in the system under consideration.",Resistance,Species,Temporal and spatial,Landscape,1,"12,000 m of transects",Before after species removal,Monthly over 2 years,"We found that (a) in general, rewiring increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks

However, the empirical order of species loss with respect to linkage has rarely been investigated. Furthermore, a species' linkage is a composite of its diet breadth and its abundance, yet the relative importance of these two factors in determining species loss order is poorly known. Here we explore the order of pollinator species loss in two contrasting study systems undergoing land-use intensification, using >20,000 pollinator specimens. We found that a pollinator species' linkage, as measured independently within plant-pollinator networks, positively predicted its persistence at human-disturbed sites in three of four analyses. The strongest predictor of persistence in all analyses was pollinator species abundance. In contrast, diet breadth poorly predicted persistence. Overall, our results suggest that community disassembly order buffers plant-pollinator networks against environmental change by retaining the highly linked species that make a disproportionate contribution to network robustness.

González-Varo1,3, Mathieu Boiffier1, Montserrat Vilà1  and Ignasi Bartomeus1","During the past decades, managed honeybee stocks have increased globally. Managed honeybees are particularly used within mass-flowering crops and often spill over to adjacent natural habitats after crop blooming. Here, we uniquely show the simultaneous impact that honeybee spillover has on wild plant and animal communities in flower-rich woodlands via changes in plantpollinator network structure that translate into a direct negative effect on the reproductive success of a dominant wild plant. Honeybee spillover leads to a re-assembly of plant–pollinator interactions through increased competition with other pollinator species. Moreover, honeybee preference for the most abundant plant species reduces its seed set, driven by high honeybee visitation rates that prevent pollen tube growth. Our study therefore calls for an adequate understanding of the trade-offs between providing pollination services to crops and the effects that managed pollinators might have on wild plants and pollinators.",2017,,,Spain,Temperate,Agricultural landscape,1,Turnover in species interactions,Persistence,Species interactions,Temporal and spatial,Site,17,2 150x1m transects per site,Intra-annual,"2 surveys per year, before after honeybee introduciont",Honeybee spillover leads to a re-assembly of plant–pollinator interactions through increased competition with other pollinator species.,Empirical,,,,Invasive species,Introduction managed honeybees,
